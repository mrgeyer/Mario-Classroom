## Create a CSV file

To expedite the creation of the CSV file, you can click Spreadsheet Log and then click Save Log. This will make the headers for you. You can open this in a spreadsheet program.

If you make a CSV file from scratch using spreadsheet software, use the following headers: Period,	 Student,	 First Name,	 Last Name,	 Power Up,	 lives,	 coins,	 calculatorNumber,	 sex,	 grade,	  incidents,	 race,	 tardies,	 special programs,	  reasons,	 comments,	 red coins


You only need to fill out Period, Student, First Name, Last Name, Power Up, lives, coins, incidents, tardies, and red coins. 

- Enter the class period for each student under Period.
- Enter the student's name as you want it to appear on the screen. If your student goes by a nickname, this is where you would put the nick name.
- Enter the student's first and last name as you want them to appear on the discipline report under First Name and Last Name.
- Put 1 for PowerUp unless you want the student to start with a powerup. Put 2 if you want them to start with the mushroom. Put 3 if you want them to start with the fire flower
- Enter 3 for lives unless you want them to start with more than 3 lives. Any amount of lives less than 3 will be changed to 3.
- Enter 0 for coins unless you want them to start with extra coins.
- Enter 0 for incidents and tardies unless the student has previous incidents or tardies. These are for the discipline report.
- Enter 0 for red coins unless the class has earned red coins already. The red coins are for class wide rewards. However, red coins are tracked by individual students because of the set up of the data system. These will be added up, so only add it to one student's total.

You can leave the other fields blank. These are mostly for the discipline report. Fill out Sex, Grade, and Special Programs if you want those to populate on the discipline report. Seperate special programs using a colon: i.e. band, chior, basketball.

The calculator number field is not being used at this time, but it is on the spreadsheet in case I want to add that feature later. This could be used for a pick a random calculator number feature. If you assigned calculator numbers, you can enter them here, but it is not necessary.

Do not enter anything in the reasons or comments columns.

Make sure to save your spreadsheet as a CSV file.
